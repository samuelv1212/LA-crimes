            <p>Our data shows that stolen cars are a huge problem for LA! Grand theft auto nearly doubled the total of any other type of crime committed. There is a lot of thievery occuring in LA. Normal theft, theft from vehicle, and theft of identity all made the top 10 for most common types of crimes committed. If you include burgalry, burgalry from vehicles, and stolen cars then thievery makes 6 of the top 10 crimes committed list. The other main type of crime being committed is violent in nature including: intimate partner assault and assault with a deadly weapon (aggravated assault).</p>

            <p>The top crimes were reported realtively quickly. On average these crimes were reported in less than 10 days exculding identity theft and normal theft. Violent crimes like battery and assault were reported much quicker than crimes of theft. All in all, LA is pretty quick at reporting serious crimes!</p>
